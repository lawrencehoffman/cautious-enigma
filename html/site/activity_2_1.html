<ul>
<li>An alias is designed to seperate your personally identifiable information (PII) from your login credentials. While an alias is very useful in terms of security, when might it be unwise or illegal to use this alias?</li>
</ul>

<p>First I will choose a name that does not have any connections to my real identity.</p>
<p>This name should be something that is very easy to remember. Here are some techniques:</p>
<ul>
<li>First name of your favorite sports player, last name of your favorite movie star</li>
<li>First name of your favorite news reporter, last name is a favorite landmark</li>
<li>First name is a character from a book, last name is the author's name</li>
</ul>
<p>These fake identities are easier to remember because Iâ€™m directly connected to them in some personal way, however they are also very hard to link back to my true identity.</p>
<p>Having chosen a name I will need a few other pieces of data which I can easily recall, namely a birthday and a home address.</p>
<p>For the birthday I often choose one the first day of the calendar month after my real birthday (or some other memorable offset.)</p>
<p>For the home address it is best to pick the address of a famous landmark that I can remember, like a sports stadium, a historic home, etc. It should not be in my hometown.</p>
<p>You now have a name, address, and date of birth which you can remember, but have nothing to do with you.</p>
