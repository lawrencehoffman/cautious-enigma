<ul>
<li>Do you think that the part of a passphrase that is most deciding factor of the relative security of that passprase is:
<ol>
<li>The number of symbols or numbers</li>
<li>The number of letters</li>
<li>The total length of the password</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="activity---create-a-secure-passphrase">Activity - Create a Secure Passphrase</h1>
<p>First, as a group read through the questions below, then go to <a href="http://www.passwordmeter.com/">PasswordMeter</a> and attempt to answer those questions by trial and error, take notes on your results. Then, go to <a href="https://howsecureismypassword.net/">howsecureismypassword</a>, and work through the same questions, trying to get the form to turn green. Did your group get different result between the two sites? If so, why do you think that is?</p>
<ol>
<li>If Alice uses only lower case letters (no spaces, numbers, or symbols) how many letters are required to get a score of 100%?</li>
<li>If Alice uses only numbers (no spaces, letters, or symbols) how many numbers are required to get a score of 100%?</li>
<li>Does it matter if it's simply the same number or pattern repeating?</li>
<li>If Alice mixes an even number of lower case, upper case, numbers, and symbols how long must her password be to get a 100%?</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="discussion">Discussion</h1>
<p>Revisit the guiding question with your group, which answer did the websites seem to support?</p>
