<li>Lets think about that alias again. Using an Alias email is not just intended to throw off stalkers who've started from our real names and are trying to enumerate our accounts. Given just your burner account, not your real name, or any other information, how would you go about trying to figure out who that account belongs to?</li>

<p>Did you know that email addresses and passwords are leaked by third party vendors quite frequently? Well, now you know, What can we do about it though? Not much. Be proactive, keep strong unique passphrases, and occasionally do a quick check of our security hygiene.</p>
<p>Head over to <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com">haveibeenpwned</a> and type in the email address you've been using. The site will tell you if your email has been leaked, and where.</p>
