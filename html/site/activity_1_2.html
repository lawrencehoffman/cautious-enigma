<ul>
<li>Can a passphrase be both secure, and easy to remember?</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="creating-easy-to-remember-passphrases">Creating Easy to Remember Passphrases</h1>
<p>For this activity your group will be making a passphrase that is as strong and easy to remember as well as appropriate to share with the class.</p>
<p>We have established that length is the most important factor in terms of the security of a passphrase. So how do we make long passphrases easier to remember?</p>
<p>Phrases that relate to places or events in our lives are easier to remember than a passphrase that looks like a random jumble of letters and symbols (which are more traditionally considered secure) for example compare <em>c0k3peps11942dog$$</em> to <em>I was in Iceland for 4 days in 2018</em>.</p>
<p>Here are some good starters:</p>
<ul>
<li>My cat is orange and 12.</li>
<li>I've been to Europe 10 times.</li>
<li>There were 212 people at my graduation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your group may use <a href="https://howsecureismypassword.net/">howsecureismypassword</a> to help create the passphrase.</p>
<p>Once your group has decided on a passphrase, go write it on the board.</p>
