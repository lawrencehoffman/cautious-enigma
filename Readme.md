# Security in Practice
### GenCyber Girls Summer Camp 2018
### South Dakota School of Mines and Technology

## Disclaimer

I am not a trained instructor, educator, or teacher. The materials and lesson 
plans presented here are my attempt at mimicking the successful techniques of 
educators with whom I've had the pleasure of working.

At the time of the creation of this class I was an undergraduate student in 
computer science. I drew upon four years of experience in the information 
security industry. The class targets what I felt was the lowest hanging 
fruit for attackers (password security) and aims to introduce students to what 
I felt were the most important of the core concepts proposed by the GenCyber 
program.

## What is it?

The materials that I used to teach a GenCyber Girls summer camp class on the 
South Dakota School of Mines and Technology (SDSMT) campus for summer 2018.

There is no day five for a number of reasons, one being that we were not able
to move as quickly as I had initially planned, two being that day five was 
initially supposed to be reserved for the students to pick a topic they wanted
to talk about.

## Using the Lessons

Please, for the love of all that is good, if you plan to use these materials do 
ensure that they're up to date. Information Security is an industry that moves 
fast and what is good practice this morning may be a sure way to get yourself 
hacked this afternoon.

If you have updates that you'd like to have included in these plans please send 
me a pull request and I'll get on it, you'll be added to the recognition list at 
the bottom of the page.

I believe (see the disclaimer) that these lessons are appropriate for students 
ages fourteen and up. That said, my experiences with GenCyber has been that the
students will have a wide range of skill level and interest in the materials.
So if you're using this for a GenCyber class, please be aware that you will have
some students moving *much* faster than others.

I plan to upload the lesson plans here as well.

## Foundational Theory

If you are in the position I found myself (an undergraduate student preparing a 
class for the first time) I recommend hitting up Google for some reading on some 
of the following topics before finalizing your plans and giving your class. Pay 
special attention to Intervention and Assessment.

* Gradual release of responsibility

* Zone of proximal development

* Cooperative learning

* Attention signals

* Mini lessons

* Extension Activities

* Intervention

* Assessment

## Recognition

I had lots of people around to hold my hand through every step of the process. 

* **Gail Menius** for taking the time away from a busy schedule to show me how
to plan lessons, and volunteering to co-teach the class two years in a row. 
This would all have been a train wreck if not for Gail.

* **Kelly Corwin** for organizing and guiding the planning, development, and 
execution of the GenCyber program at SDSM&T.

* **Logan Lembke** and **Benjamin Garcia** for being the TAs without which the 
class would have been a wreck.

* **Val Manes** for printing off hundreds of those *3-2-1* sheets and not 
complaining when I simply stole them.
