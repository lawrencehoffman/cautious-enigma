Create a Burner Email
=====================

Guiding Question
----------------

* Most email services now require new users to sign up with some form of 
  alternate contact information like an email, phone, or home address. 
  Why do you think this is?

Creating a ProtonMail Burner
----------------------------

A burner email account is an account that you can use to sign up for other
services, which you prefer not to give your real name or contact information 
to. 

ProtonMail is one of the few remaining services which allows new users to 
sign up for an account without handing over *any* personal identifiable 
information (PII). We'll be using the Aliases we created earlier to create
our burner accounts.

.. _ProtonMail: https://protonmail.com

So let's head over to the ProtonMail_ website, at the top right of the splash
page you'll see a button that says sign up, go ahead and click that.

This should get you an accordian menu with different levels of accounts, as 
we are not planning to pay for anything today, click on the "free" box to open 
that part of the menu.

Click select free plan.

Now we're going to make use of that alias, fill in the username field as 
though the alias were your real name and you're trying to make the email easy
for your friends to remember. If your username is not available in its 
simplest form, add a number or some punctuation, or remove the punctuation.
Below I have added a period to make my username unique.

Create a secure passphrase, just like we learned in class yesterday, one you
can remember but that is long. ProtonMail encrypts your data, so if you forget
this password, the account will not be recoverable.

Do **not** input a recovery email. We do not want this account to be tied to 
our real identity in anyway. Including anything you've done before today in
the creation of this account creates history, which makes it closer to you.

When you're done, click the "CREATE ACCOUNT" button at the bottom.

Now ProtonMail is going to ask you to verify that you understand that because
you have not entered a recovery email you'll be out of luck if you forget the
passphrase you typed. Click confirm.

Time to prove you're a human, select the CAPTCHA, all of the other options
will give ProtonMail information we don't want them to have. *Does it bother
anyone else that we now have self driving cars, yet the ultimate test of not
being a robot is your ability to identify cars in a picture...*

When you've validated your humanity hit "COMPLETE SETUP"

Note that ProtonMail is now encrypting yoru data with newly generated keys.

Last step, you'll want to set the display name to be in step with your alias
so go ahead and put your alias in here. **DON'T HIT ANY OF THE ICONS** these
will link your real twitter, facebook, etc to ProtonMail and you're alias will
be compromised. Also **DON'T DOWNLOAD THE APP** this also leaks your identity
to ProtonMail.

Congratulations, you have an anonymous burner account!
