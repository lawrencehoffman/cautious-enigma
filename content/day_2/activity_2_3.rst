Damage Control?
===============

Guiding Question
----------------

* Lets think about that alias again. Using an Alias email is
  not just intended to throw off stalkers who've started from
  our real names and are trying to enumerate our accounts.
  Given just your burner account, not your real name, or any
  other information, how would you go about trying to figure
  out who that account belongs to?

Cause for Concern
-----------------

Did you know that email addresses and passwords are leaked
by third party vendors quite frequently? Well, now you know,
What can we do about it though? Not much. Be proactive, keep
strong unique passphrases, and occasionally do a quick check
of our security hygiene.
