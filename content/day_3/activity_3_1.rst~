Passphrase Management
=====================

Guiding Question
----------------

* The holy grail of secure passphrases is a long random string,
  but those are hard to remember. Passphrase managers exist to
  securely create and maintain passphrases, but they lead to a
  new problem, now all of your passphrases are stored in one
  place, if someone obtains access, they have *everything*.
  Think of some ways we could add another layer of security to
  our passphrase management systems.
