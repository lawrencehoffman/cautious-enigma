Two Factor Authentication
=========================

Guiding Question
----------------

Two factor authentication is meant to require the user to be in possession of
some object which will prove the users identity at the time of authentication.
Some example two factor schemes include:

#. User has physical a "key" which generates a random pin every 30 seconds
#. User registers a cell phone number, a code is texted to the phone
#. User registers a smart phone, a code is generated by the phone (like 1.)
#. User registers an email, a code is sent to the email
#. User chooses an item form a large list, must know which item at login
#. User registers a phone, at login a barcode is displayed, it must be scanned
   with the user's phone.

Some of these are better than others, some are not really two factor at all. How
would your group attempt to attack an organization using these two factor 
methods?

Setting Up Two-Factor for LastPass
----------------------------------

Earlier we mentioned that LastPass's master password is a single point of 
failure in our personal security scheme. Let's beef that up some.

* If you don't have smartphone please join someone who does, and watch them 
  walk through the process.

From the LastPass plugin click on "Open My Vault" .Once in your vault click 
on "Account Settings" in the lower left portion of the screen.

When the account settings window opens click on "Multifactor Options"

This will open the Multifactor Options page. Let's use Google Authenticator
as it seems to work with the largest number of other sites. Click the pencil
to the far right to edit the settings for Google Authenticator.

You'll need to download and install the Authenticator App (if you don't have 
it already) there is a link at the top of the window that will help you to get
this done for whatever device type you have. Please ask instructors if you get
stuck.

Once you have the app installed click on the "View your barcode" link.

Before you're able to view your barcode, you'll need to nput your master 
passphrase again, then a barcode will come up like the one below.

Open the Google Authenticator app on your phone and click the '+' button on the
bottom right. Select 'scan a barcode' and scan the barcode that is showing on your
screen.

Once you've scanned the barcode with your phone you'll see a new entry in Google
Authenticator for LastPass. Go hit the OK button on the barcode window in LastPass.

Change the 'Enabled' to 'Yes' and hit update. You'll need to re-enter your master
password again.

Next you'll need to open Google Authenticator on your phone, and input the number 
that is currently displayed on the screen into the box. You'll also have to do this
whenever you log into LastPass from now on.

You should now see a green "Enabled" next to Google Authenticator. Congratulations!
You've added a nice thick layer of security to your LastPass passphrase manager.
